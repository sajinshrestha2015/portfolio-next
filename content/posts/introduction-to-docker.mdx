# Learning Docker: A Step-by-Step Guide

Docker is a powerful platform for containerizing applications, making it easier
to deploy and scale them. Follow these steps to get started with Docker:

## Step 1: Understand the Basics

Learn what Docker is and its core concepts:

- **Containers**: Lightweight, portable application environments.
- **Images**: The blueprint for containers.
- **Docker Hub**: The registry for Docker images.
- **Docker Engine**: The runtime that powers Docker.

---

## Step 2: Install Docker

1. Visit the [Docker website](https://www.docker.com/).
2. Download Docker Desktop for your operating system:
   - Windows
   - macOS
   - Linux
3. Follow the installation instructions and verify the installation by running:

```bash
docker --version
```

## Step 3: Run Your First Container

Try running a container using a pre-built image:

```bash
docker run hello-world
```

This command pulls the hello-world image from Docker Hub and runs it,
demonstrating that Docker is working on your system.

## Step 4: Learn Docker Commands

- **docker pull image-name**: Download an image.
- **docker images**: List all downloaded images.
- **docker ps**: List running containers.
- **docker stop container-name**: Stop a running container.

## Step 5: Build Your Own Image

1. Create a Dockerfile with the following content:

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl
CMD ["echo", "Hello, Docker!"]
```

2. Build the image:

```bash
docker build -t my-image .
```

3. Run a container using your image:

```bash
docker run my-image
```

## Step 6: Work with Docker Compose

Docker Compose simplifies multi-container setups:

1. Install Docker Compose if it’s not included with Docker Desktop.
2. Create a docker-compose.yml file:

```yml
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    image: nginx
    ports:
      - '8080:80'
```

3. Start the application:

```bash
docker-compose up
<CopyButton text="docker-compose up" />
```

## Step 7: Dive into Advanced Topics

Once comfortable with the basics, explore:

- **Networking**: Connect multiple containers.
- **Volumes**: Persist data.
- **Docker Swarm or Kubernetes**: Orchestrate container deployments.
- **CI/CD with Docker**: Integrate Docker into your development pipeline.
