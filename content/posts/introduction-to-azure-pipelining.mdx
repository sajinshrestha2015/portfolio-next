# Learning Azure Pipelines

Azure Pipelines is a powerful tool for automating build and integration
processes. This guide provides a structured approach to learning Azure Pipelines
effectively.

---

## **Step 1: Understand the Basics**

Before diving into Azure Pipelines, familiarize yourself with its core concepts:

- **Pipelines**: Automate workflows for building, testing, and deploying code.
- **Stages**: Logical divisions within a pipeline (e.g., Build, Test, Deploy).
- **Jobs**: Units of work within stages, which run independently.
- **Steps**: Tasks or scripts executed within a job.
- **Triggers**: Conditions for starting a pipeline (e.g., code push to a
  branch).

---

## **Step 2: Set Up Your Azure DevOps Account**

1. Go to [Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com/).
2. Sign up or log in with your Microsoft account.
3. Create a new project to organize your repositories, pipelines, and artifacts.

---

## **Step 3: Create Your First Pipeline**

### Using the Azure DevOps UI

1. Navigate to the **Pipelines** tab in your Azure DevOps project.
2. Click **New Pipeline** and follow these steps:
   - Connect to your repository (e.g., GitHub, Azure Repos).
   - Select a pipeline configuration (YAML or classic editor).
3. Save and run the pipeline to see it in action.

### Using a YAML File

Start with a basic `azure-pipelines.yml` file in your repository:

```yaml
trigger:
  branches:
    include:
      - main

pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

steps:
  - script: echo "Hello, Azure Pipelines!"
    displayName: 'Print a welcome message'
```

---

## **Step 4: Learn by Experimenting**

### Add Build Steps

- Install dependencies: `npm install`, `pip install`, or similar for your tech
  stack.
- Compile code: Use build tools like `msbuild`, `webpack`, or `make`.

---

## **Step 5: Explore Advanced Features**

- **Multi-Stage Pipelines**: Define and orchestrate multiple stages in a single
  YAML file.
- **Templates**: Reuse pipeline configurations across multiple repositories.
- **Variables**: Use predefined and custom variables to simplify workflows.
- **Artifacts**: Manage build outputs and dependencies.
- **Triggers**: Configure continuous integration (CI) or continuous delivery
  (CD).

---

## **Step 6: Monitor and Troubleshoot**

- Use the **Logs** in the Azure Pipelines UI to debug issues.
- Enable **Pipeline Insights** for detailed analytics on pipeline performance.
- Set up notifications for pipeline failures or successes.

---

## **Step 7: Reference Documentation**

- [Azure Pipelines Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/?view=azure-devops)
- [Azure Pipelines YAML Schema](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/yaml-schema?view=azure-devops&tabs=example)

Start small by automating simple tasks and gradually build more complex
pipelines as you become comfortable. **Happy learning!**
